## Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Say it in Russian! How much did you make me?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Who are those horrible orange men? **Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.** _Come, Comrade Bender!_ We must take to the streets!

### For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

1. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
2. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.
3. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

#### Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

1. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
2. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.
3. Why did you bring us here?

Tell her she looks thin. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Who are those horrible orange men? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

Who are you, my warranty?! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

No! Don't jump! I'm a thing. Shinier than yours, meatbag. No, just a regular mistake. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? You're going to do his laundry?

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! I love you, buddy! And I'm his friend Jesus.

Is that a cooking show? Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You lived before you met me?! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. And until then, I can never die? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
