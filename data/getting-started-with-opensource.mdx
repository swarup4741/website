While contributing to open source projects gives you an immense opportunity to learn, expand your knowledge vessel and get an experience of working on a real life project of vast scale but we often get intimidated while facing a huge code base which we have no idea or clue about. We sit for a while and then imposter syndrome comes into play.

But do not worry. I have been through this phase as well. Today I'm going to walk you through several steps on how to get started with open source contribution. But first lets talk about open source a little bit.

Developers around the world are always working on some kind of problem which is either related to their personal projects or a global scale project which will be used by several users. Now if developer A is solving a particular problem then it might occur that developer B is also trying to solve that same problem. So now developer A has solved it and he/she decides to put up the source code on github and provides a suitable license to it so that other developers (like developer B) can either use it or contribute to it to make it better. This is what is know as an open souce project (I hope it made some sense).

## Steps towards contribution

### Finding an open source project on github

First we need to find an open source project which aligns with our current knowledge realm. Github has an awesome search functionality to filter out projects according to our own need.

Open [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your accout if you haven't. Then navigate to **issues** tab situated in navbar.

  height={96}
  width={1900}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="issues tab"
/>

After opening the issues tab we will get to see a page like this where all the magic will begin.

<Image
  src="/posts/getting-started-with-opensource/issues-page.png"
  height={912}
  width={1900}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="issues page"
/>

Now we will utilize github's powerful search functionality to query through open source projects and find one to contribute to.
Go to the **search all issues** input box then type the following filters :

<InlineCode>
  is:open is:issue language:javascript label:"good first issue"
</InlineCode>

Now lets understand the meaning of each of these filters.

- <InlineCode>is:open is:issue</InlineCode> - This refers to repositories whose issues
  are currently open.
- <InlineCode>language:javascript</InlineCode> - This refers to repositories whose
  major language is javascript.
- <InlineCode>label:"good first issue"</InlineCode> - This refers to issues that
  have a good first issue label on them which means those issues are good for people
  who are beginners to open source. sometimes you can only find similar label as
  first timers only.

you can also learn more about these filters over [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

Now after hitting search with these filters you will get results somewhat like this.

<Image
  src="/posts/getting-started-with-opensource/selected-issue.png"
  height={900}
  width={1890}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="filtered issues"
/>

Now you will be able to see lots of repositories with <InlineCode>good first issue</InlineCode> label. Go through some of the issue statement and figure out which
one you want to work on. I decided to take number 3 issue with repository named
[LockTech/atomic](https://github.com/LockTech/atomic). I choose it because it seems to be related to **CSS** which
is an easy topic to work on as a beginner. After opening the issue, we can see
that the author of this issue has described the problem to be solved. If it seems
confusing to you,ask questions about it in the comment section. Don't be shy!

  width={1890}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="issue description"
/>

After making it all clear ask the maintainer of the project to assign it to you. Also ask him/her on where to begin if you are unable to find the problem in the code base (which usually happens when you face a huge code base for the first time).
Also ask for help whenever you get stuck because this improves you communication skills which is an essential thing to build up if you want to work in a team.

/>

### Forking and Cloning the project

Now its time to **fork** and **clone** the project into our local machine. But before that we must read something called **contribution guidelines** which most of the project has in form of <InlineCode>CONTRIBUTING.md</InlineCode>, a markdown file which is located in the repository itself. This file contains the necessary protocols and
information that we need to follow while contributing to an open source project and this varies as per project requirements.

After reading it, we will now **fork** the repository into our account that is we will make a copy of this project into our account so that we do not accidentally affect the
**main branch** of the current project. You can find the fork button at the top right corner of the project page. After that you will observe that the project has been forked and the repository name changes to
**your_username/project_name**. Now we will **clone** the project into our local machine using the **HTTPS** method. Click on the green **Code** button and then copy the **HTTPS** url.

  src="/posts/getting-started-with-opensource/clone.png"
  height={910}
  width={1890}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="clone the project"
/>

Now open your terminal (I assume that you have **git** installed) and run the following the command to clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your_username}/atomic.git
```

After cloning is complete then **cd** into the project directory using <InlineCode>cd {project_name}</InlineCode>. In my case it will be <InlineCode>cd atomic</InlineCode>. Now run <InlineCode>npm install</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>yarn</InlineCode> (as per your choice and I also assume you have **node** installed) to install all the dependencies of the project.

```bash
~ ‚ñ≤ ~ cd /e/code
code ‚ñ≤ ~ git clone https://github.com/swarup4741/atomic.git

```

### Making changes and pushing code

Now open your project folder inside any text-editor or IDE of your choice (my preference is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it provides inbuilt terminal, source control which allows you to see the changes made and many other features). Now make changes to the code base as per your requirement and verify it by asking the maintainer of the project and request him/her to guide you if you get stuck.
After making your changes now we are ready for the most exciting part of this entire process that is pushing the code for review and waiting to get accepted and merged to the **main branch**.

The changes that I made were adding new utility classes for input validation label of input component.

<Image
  src="/posts/getting-started-with-opensource/changes.png"
  height={945}
  width={1830}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="changes made"
/>

you can also see the changes made using <InlineCode>git diff</InlineCode> command.
Now lets push the changes we made. The following commands will help you push the changes.

- <InlineCode>git checkout -b "new_branch_name"</InlineCode> - This command lets
  you checkout of the current branch (main) and switches to the new branch name provided.
  Here we are switching branch because if we push our changes to the current branch
  then we will lose the previous state of the code base and hence cannot access it
  if we need it further along the way.
- <InlineCode>git add .</InlineCode> - This command lets you add all the files to
  git staging area which contains a list of all the files you have recently changed.
- <InlineCode>git commit -m "commit_message"</InlineCode> - This command lets you
  commit (its like taking a snapshot of your repository) the changes to your local
  repository with a commit message which usually describes briefly the changes you
  made.
- <InlineCode>git push</InlineCode> - This command lets you upload the changes from
  your local repository to a remote repository (currently your upstream branch or
  the new branch )

Now you might see that your push is being aborted. This happens because your current new branch has no upstream branch that is it doesn't have the same name as your local branch. This is a safety measure taken by git. But don't worry, you can still push your changes using this command -

<InlineCode>
  git push --set-upstream-to origin "your_current_branch_name"
</InlineCode>

```bash
atomic (main) ‚ñ≤ ~ git checkout -b input-label
Switched to a new branch 'input-label'
atomic (input-label) ‚ñ≤ ~ git add .
atomic (input-label) ‚ñ≤ ~ git commit -m "add input validation label utility classes"
[input-label 5896e2e] add input validation label utility classes
 2 files changed, 38 insertions(+)
atomic (input-label) ‚ñ≤ ~ git push
fatal: The current branch input-label has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

  git push --set-upstream origin input-label

atomic (input-label) ‚ñ≤ ~ git push --set-upstream origin input-label

```

### Creating pull request

After you have pushed your changes, now its time to create a **pull request** which means you are about to create a request with your branch (where you recently pushed your changes, in my case <InlineCode>input-label</InlineCode>) towards the **main branch** to be merged with it.
Now while creating a pull request you must provide the information about the changes you made.

Now to create a pull request visit the forked repository (you can find it in your list of repositories) in your github account. There you can find a green button named **compare & pull request**. Click it to visit the page shown below and describe the changes you made.

  height={895}
  width={1880}
  layout="responsive"
  objectFit="cover"
  alt="pull request made"
/>

Once you have created the pull request, now we just need to wait for our changes to be approved and merged by the maintainer.

It might happen that the maintainer may request a further change if he/she is not satisified with the changes you made. So don't be upset or demotivated thinking that you were unable to make the necessary changes in one go. Instead try to understand what they want and I repeat always ask for help if you get stuck. If you need to make futher changes the process remains the same.

- Make the necessary changes
- Follow last two steps

Once your pull request gets merged with the **main branch** you will get a notification similar to this.
